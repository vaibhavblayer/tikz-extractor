# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TikZ Extractor CLI is a Python package that provides both a command-line interface and importable module for recursively extracting TikZ picture environments from codebases. The system scans specified file types, extracts TikZ blocks, saves them as separate .tex files, and generates an AI-context file containing all extracted snippets for LLM consumption.

## Glossary

- **TikZ_Extractor_System**: The complete Python package including CLI and importable module
- **TikZ_Block**: A complete tikzpicture environment from \begin{tikzpicture} to \end{tikzpicture}
- **Source_Directory**: The directory tree to scan for TikZ blocks
- **Output_Directory**: The directory where extracted .tex files are written
- **AI_Context_File**: A concatenated text file containing all extracted TikZ blocks with headers
- **Extraction_Metadata**: Structured data about each extracted block including source path, output path, and content

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extract TikZ picture environments from my codebase, so that I can reuse them in other documents or provide them as context to AI models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the extraction command, THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL recursively scan the Source_Directory for files with specified extensions
2. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL extract all complete TikZ_Block instances from scanned files using robust multi-line pattern matching
3. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL write each extracted TikZ_Block to a separate .tex file in the Output_Directory with a readable filename format
4. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL generate Extraction_Metadata for each extracted block containing source path, output path, index, and content
5. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL create an AI_Context_File containing all extracted blocks with structured headers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a command-line interface with flexible options, so that I can customize the extraction process for different projects and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL provide a CLI command "tikz-extract" accessible after package installation
2. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL accept a source directory parameter with default value of current working directory
3. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL accept an output directory parameter with default value of "tikz"
4. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL accept a comma-separated list of file extensions with default value of ".tex,.md,.py"
5. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL accept an AI context file path parameter with default value of "ai_context.txt"
6. WHEN the user specifies the dry-run flag, THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL display extraction results without writing files
7. WHEN the user specifies the verbose flag, THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL display detailed processing information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package to be importable as a Python module, so that I can integrate TikZ extraction functionality into my own scripts and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL be installable as a Python package using Poetry
2. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL be importable using "import tikz_extractor"
3. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL expose core extraction functions through the module interface
4. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL provide functions for directory scanning, TikZ extraction, and AI context file generation
5. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL maintain minimal external dependencies limited to Click for CLI functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust file handling and error recovery, so that the extraction process continues even when encountering problematic files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TikZ_Extractor_System encounters an unreadable file, THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL skip the file and continue processing
2. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL handle files with different text encodings using UTF-8 as the primary encoding
3. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL create output directories automatically if they do not exist
4. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL generate unique filenames for extracted blocks to prevent overwrites
5. WHEN no TikZ blocks are found, THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL inform the user and exit gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and documentation, so that I can trust the package reliability and understand its usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include unit tests that verify extraction functionality on sample file trees
2. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include tests that run without network access
3. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL provide clear help text accessible via "--help" flag
4. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include usage examples in the CLI help output
5. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL maintain consistent code style with docstrings for all public functions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive Python testing patterns for all functions, so that I can ensure code quality and reliability through proper unit and integration testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include unit tests for each individual function using Python unittest or pytest framework
2. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include integration tests that verify the complete orchestration workflow from directory scanning to AI context file generation
3. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include test fixtures with sample TikZ blocks in various file formats for consistent testing
4. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include tests that verify error handling and edge cases for each function
5. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include CLI integration tests that verify command-line argument parsing and execution flow
6. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include tests that verify file I/O operations including directory creation and file writing
7. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL maintain test coverage for all public functions and critical code paths

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want thorough documentation and automated publishing workflows, so that the package can be easily distributed via PyPI and GitHub with proper CI/CD integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include a comprehensive README.md file with installation instructions, usage examples for both CLI and module interfaces, and API documentation
2. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, linting, and publishing to PyPI
3. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include detailed docstrings for all public functions following Python documentation standards
4. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include CLI help documentation with usage examples and parameter descriptions
5. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include module-level documentation explaining the package architecture and main components
6. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include contribution guidelines and development setup instructions in the repository
7. THE TikZ_Extractor_System SHALL include automated documentation generation for API reference using tools like Sphinx or similar
